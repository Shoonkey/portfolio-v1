# Flash card app

An app for creating flash cards to help you study and remember things better. I currently use it mainly for studying Japanese kanji

## Known issues

- Animation doesn't work when heading left instead of right

## Features to implement

- Edit existing cards
- Keep history of cards in memory, so that it doesn't "progress" by going left after reaching the stage "complete"
